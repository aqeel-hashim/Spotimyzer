## What is it?
This is an app that I buuilt for a hackathon while part of the team SAS Ninja Las. We came in 1st for that. 

## What is it for?
The hackathon was for NBIoT platform. We came with the idea of using NBIoT to send data to Firebase about parking spots. Users can rent out parking space and there we built a device that goes into the ground to detect vehicles and send data to Firebase via Mobitels NBIot platform. This app is of the potential user of the parking spot

## Technologies used:
### Firebase
  For Data storage and User authentication.
### Butterknife for Android
  Amazing tool that provides Annotation to link XML UI components in the Java code. Uses Code generation. Super fun.
  Has many other features all using annotations. Annotations a used to create the init function and any other functions including async     funtions and user control handlers for UI.
### Google Maps
  With GMaps UI customizing 
  
This was the Mobitel NBIoT hackathon
